You can find more details of how to configure and publish source from Github into Github pages acessing this link: https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages .

## Deployment

This project is using `angular-cli-ghpages` to deploy our code to Github pages. So it requires a Github account and a repository to be deployed.

After that, make sure the Github branch is up-to-date with your code changes and run this commands:

```
ng deploy --base-href=/comic-hub/
# or
npm run ng deploy --base-href=/comic-hub/
```

If you prefer, you can just run `./deploy.sh`. Easy, peasy! ðŸ˜Š

## Development instructions
